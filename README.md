# Health Insurance Project

This project is designed to help with analyzing and managing health insurance data. It aims to provide insights into insurance coverage, claims, policyholder data, and predictive analytics to improve decision-making for health insurance providers. The platform includes features for data analysis, reporting, and machine learning models to predict healthcare costs and policyholder behavior.

    ```

3. Set up your database or adjust the database configuration in `config.py`.

4. Run the project:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Input the necessary insurance data (e.g., policyholder details, claim history) into the system.
2. Use the available analytics tools to explore data trends, generate reports, or make predictions.
3. View results and visualizations in the dashboard or via output files.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze insurance claims, premiums, and policyholder data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict healthcare costs, claim frequency, or fraud detection.
- **Visualization**: Display data insights with interactive charts and graphs.
- **Reporting**: Generate summary reports based on data analytics.

## Technologies

- **Python**: For data analysis and machine learning.
